# Hi there! 👋

My name is Joaquín, I have a degree in Biological Sciences. I studied at the Faculty of Sciences (UdelaR), where I had the opportunity to design an automated pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families using Bash, Python and R. This project was recognized with the best poster prize in the undergraduate student category at the Uruguayan Society of Biosciences (SUB) congress. I am currently collaborating on an applied genomic project in a research institute.

Besides my degree in Biological Sciences, I have included topics such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computing, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability in my studies.

## 🔭 Working on:
- Improving Bioinformatic pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families 🧬
- Developing MReport an user friendly  pipeline for applied genomics

## 🛠 Skills:
- Bash (Intermediate)💻
- Python (Intermediate)🐍
- R (Begginer)📊

## 🎯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Software Development Projects, particularly those with an emphasis in applied bioinformatics  💡
- Developing and utilizing pipelines for processing and visualizing data.
