# Hello, World! 👋

My name is Joaquín, an advanced student in Biological Sciences. Currently, I'm studying at the Faculty of Sciences (UdelaR), where I've had the opportunity to design an automated pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families using Bash, Python and R. This project was recognized with the best poster prize in the undergraduate student category at the Uruguayan Society of Biosciences (SUB) congress.

My academic journey so far has included in-depth study in areas such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computing, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability.

## 🔭 Working on:
- Improving Bioinformatic pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families 🧬

## 🛠 Skills:
- Bash 💻
- Python 🐍
- R 📊

## 🎯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Software Development Projects 💡
- Artificial Intelligence Applications 🧠

## ⚡ Fun fact:
- I love Jogging and training hard 🏃
- Trying to cook the perfect Bread 🍞
- D&D Master 🐉 🧙
