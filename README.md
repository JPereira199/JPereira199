# Hi there! 👋

My name is Joaquín, I have a degree in Biological Sciences. I studied at the Faculty of Sciences (UdelaR), where I had the opportunity to design an automated pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families using Bash, Python and R. This project was recognized with the best poster prize in the undergraduate student category at the Uruguayan Society of Biosciences (SUB) congress. I am currently collaborating on an applied genomic project in a research institute.

My academic journey so far has included in-depth study in areas such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computing, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability.

## 🔭 Working on:
- Improving Bioinformatic pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families 🧬
- Developing a pipeline with QIIME2 and SnakeMake for applied genomics

## 🛠 Skills:
- Bash (Intermediate)💻
- Python (Beginner)🐍
- R (Begginer)📊

## 🎯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Software Development Projects, especially those at the intersection of biology and technology 💡
- Artificial Intelligence Applications related to bioinformatics 🧠

## ⚡ Fun fact:
- I love Jogging and training hard 🏃
- Trying to cook the perfect Bread 🍞
- D&D Master 🐉 🧙
