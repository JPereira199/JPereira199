# Hi there! 👋

My name is Joaquín. I have a degree in Biological Sciences and I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics in Uruguay. During my undergraduate studies, I designed an automated pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families using Bash, Python, and R. This project was awarded the best poster prize in the undergraduate student category at the Uruguayan Society of Biosciences (SUB) congress.

I’m currently developing a pipeline that integrates metagenomic and direct sequencing data for an applied genomics project focused on cattle health at the Clemente Estable Institute of Biological Research (IIBCE).

In addition to my degree in Biological Sciences, I’ve also studied Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability.

## 🔭 Currently working on:
- Improving a bioinformatics pipeline to cluster, search, and visualize multigene families 🧬
- Developing **MReport**, a user-friendly pipeline for applied genomics

## 🛠 Skills:
- Python, Bash, R 💻
- Snakemake, Nextflow 🔁
- Data Analysis 📈
- Data Visualization 🖼️

## 🎯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Software development projects, especially those with a focus on applied bioinformatics 💡
- Developing and implementing pipelines for data processing and visualization
